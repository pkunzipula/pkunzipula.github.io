After leaving the Shire, I decided to get a Bachelor's in Communications. I was the first of my friends to have a degree. "He's goin' places!" they all said. Then the Simpsons did this:
[![IMAGE Communications Degree](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_4OuAAM4v_Y/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4OuAAM4v_Y). My friends laughed at me. I was communicationless to defend myself. But then... it **happened!**

I got my first job in communications! The Oldies radio station hired me, the communicator to... write copy?  Nope. Talk on the air? No... wait, what? Sell airtime? That's the one! For 4 hours each morning, I, the 23 year old, cold called businesses owned by baby boomers to communicate the message "Advertise or DIE!" in a diplomatic way that only a degree-holding communicator could. The nice ones said "Call me back when the new fiscal year starts." How did they know I wouldn't last that long?! The others told me to lose their number and *bleep* off. For the next 4 hours, I got in my car and cold walked into business, where I enjoyed the same general reception and success rate. Eventually I started using those last 4 hours to seek a different path. On one particular afternoon, I stood in line for 3 hours to audition for the boy band that became O-Town. They said I was too old and couldn't dance and couldn't sing. But keep trying.

So I showed them. I moved to Seattle, worked at Starbucks, declared bankruptcy, moved back home and went to Graduate School for education.

My students often asked me what teacher or life event inspired me to go into teaching high school. I answered honestly: "Education was the only building I didn't go into when I was in college the first time. I wanted to see what was in there."

I taught English to high schoolers for a semester. Then Sideways came out, and Jack told Miles "You're wasting away - teaching English to f*cking eighth graders, they ought to be reading what you wrote. Your books Miles."

I didn't quit teaching. But I switched subjects. For 6 years I taught Microsoft Office and web design to high schoolers.

Then I quit. I like to do new things and 6 years was a long time to do the same thing. But the 2.5 years I've spent in my current office job already feels like an eternity. Much of that time has been spent taking our paper office online, where I've baloneyed together a hodge-podge of solutions that don't really want to play nice with each other. If the office ran like a pogo stick before I got there, I can confidently say it now hums along like a car held together by duct-tape.

It was a conversation with a booking software company that "doesn't deal with gun ranges" that made me wonder if I could have learned and built my own system in the years I spent asking for features and support from everyone else. So I enrolled in Bloc. I am academically reinvigorated with a mission to create an entire system that solves all our problems. If it works for other people too, maybe I'll get to quit my desk job someday and save the world whenever I wake up.

The End
